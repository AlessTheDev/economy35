     * of the image when scan conversion is done with sampling at a low
     * frequency, which is also known as Undersampling. Aliasing occurs when real-world
     * objects which comprise smooth, continuous curves are rasterized using pixels.
     * The cause of anti-aliasing is Undersampling.
     * Enabling antialiasing may impact performance.
